        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The Hawa Mahal in Jaipur is considered as one of the most iconic attractions of the city. The five-storey building looks like a honeycomb of a beehive and it is always windy inside, owing to the numerous windows and jharokhas. This amazing ventilation that the palace enjoys is the reason why it was named as the Hawa Mahal, which literally translates into the “Palace of the Winds”.The Hawa Mahal is dedicated to Lord Krishna. It is said that the shape of the building resembles the crown of Krishna. More than a palace, the Hawa Mahal is also a cultural and architectural marvel that reflects a truly harmonious amalgamation of the Hindu Rajput and Islamic Mughal architectural styles.</p>
